Mucking around with web programming
-----------------------------------

 - The vast majority of the code here was developed in about 3 days
   while I was teachimg myself the basics of web programming as
   well as running my own LAMP server. Hopefully this will change as
   soon as I actually have time to do some web programming.

 - Test deployments of code I plan to use on 
   [tomzaki.com](http://www.tomzaki.com) will likely show up here 
   first, if you're curious and want to see what's in development.
   
 - Currently I'm working on some php based EE design tools as well as
   php login script for a restricted section of tomzaki.com. Check out
   the php directory in the repo or 
   [this page](http://webserver.tomzaki.com/php) for more details. 
   If you happen to know whats causing the usort() bug on the resistor
   gain tool page LET ME KNOW PLEASE :D
