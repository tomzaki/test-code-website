Mucking around with web programming

 - The vast majority of the code here was developed in about 3 days
   while I was teachimg myself the basics of web programming as
   well as running my own LAMP server

 - Test deployments of code I plan to use on other web pages will
   likely show up here first

 - When a more permanent URL (that is not my IP address) is
   assigned to this page I'll add that here for reference
