Mucking around with web programming: http://webserver.tomzaki.com

 - The vast majority of the code here was developed in about 3 days
   while I was teachimg myself the basics of web programming as
   well as running my own LAMP server

 - Test deployments of code I plan to use on other web pages will
   likely show up here first
   
 - Currently working on some php based EE design tools. Check out
   the php directory (or page if you're browsing the site) for
   more details. If you happen to know whats causing the usort()
   bug on the resistor gain tool page LET ME KNOW PLEASE :D
